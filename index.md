This page contains a non-exhaustive list of big open problems that remain unsolved despite being both highly puzzling and of great significance. They have resisted attempts by countless people to explain them - perhaps you will succeed where they have failed?

The list will be in descending order of importance that I assign to the puzzles. We start with:

### The Industrial Revolution

What is perhaps most mysterious about the [Industrial Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution) is the lack of recognition among most people that there is a big mystery to be explained here. Wikipedia states that

> The Industrial Revolution was the transition to new manufacturing processes in Europe and the United States, in the period from between 1760 to 1820 and 1840. This transition included going from hand production methods to machines, new chemical manufacturing and iron production processes, the increasing use of steam power and water power, the development of machine tools and the rise of the mechanized factory system. The Industrial Revolution also led to an unprecedented rise in the rate of population growth.

This is not even an adequate *definition* of the Industrial Revolution. As Robin Hanson notes in [*Long-Term Growth As A Sequence of Exponential Modes*](https://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/longgrow.pdf), what we really have to explain is a *phase transition* in economic activity. Sometime around the year 1800, GWP (gross world product) went from doubling roughly every 1000 years to doubling roughly every 15 years, and we have been in the new regime ever since then. This is a dramatic transformation of the world economy, comparable to a phase transition from solid to liquid or from liquid to gas.

Just in case this description is sufficiently evocative, here is a picture of what that looks like:

The transition was not even that smooth, and there's a visible elbow point on the graph around the year 1800. This is the mystery that has to be explained - so what explanations have people offered for this remarkable phenomenon? It's of course impossible for this list to be exhaustive, but I try to cover some of the common explanations along with the reasons why they fall short [here](https://ege-erdil.github.io/mysteries/industrial_revolution).
