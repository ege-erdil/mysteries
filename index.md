This page contains a non-exhaustive list of big open problems that remain unsolved despite being both highly puzzling and of great significance. They have resisted attempts by countless people to explain them - perhaps you will succeed where they have failed?

The list will be in descending order of importance that I assign to the puzzles. We start with:

### The Industrial Revolution

What is perhaps most mysterious about the [Industrial Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution) is the lack of recognition among most people that there is a big mystery to be explained here. Wikipedia states that

> The Industrial Revolution was the transition to new manufacturing processes in Europe and the United States, in the period from between 1760 to 1820 and 1840. This transition included going from hand production methods to machines, new chemical manufacturing and iron production processes, the increasing use of steam power and water power, the development of machine tools and the rise of the mechanized factory system. The Industrial Revolution also led to an unprecedented rise in the rate of population growth.

This is not even an adequate *definition* of the Industrial Revolution. As Robin Hanson notes in [*Long-Term Growth As A Sequence of Exponential Modes*](https://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/longgrow.pdf), what we really have to explain is a *phase transition* in economic activity. Sometime around the year 1800, GWP (gross world product) went from doubling roughly every 1000 years to doubling roughly every 15 years, and we have been in the new regime ever since then. This is a dramatic transformation of the world economy, comparable to a phase transition from solid to liquid or from liquid to gas, and merits an explanation that is comparable to Landau's model of second order phase transitions.

Just in case this description is not sufficiently evocative, here is a picture of what that looks like:

The transition was not even that smooth, and there's a visible elbow point on the graph around the year 1800. This is the mystery that has to be explained - so what explanations have people offered for this remarkable phenomenon? It's of course impossible for this list to be exhaustive, but I try to cover some of the common explanations along with the reasons why they fall short [here](https://ege-erdil.github.io/mysteries/industrial_revolution).

### Nominal shocks have real effects?

This is a mystery that is at the heart of macroeconomics, and one that has still not been resolved satisfactorily. If you've ever heard about [aggregate supply curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AD%E2%80%93AS_model) or [Phillips curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phillips_curve), you likely already know what this puzzle is about, but if not here is a short explanation:

In principle, thinking of money as a unit of account, we might expect that changes in the value of money should not have much real impact on the economy. While how fast or how slowly money loses its value should affect how much of it people choose to hold through an "inflation tax", there should be no particular reason that a one-time change in the value of a currency should have any impact on economic activity, since the prices of goods and services would just adjust accordingly so that the same fraction of the total money stock still has the same purchasing power as before the revaluation.

Indeed, sometimes this seems to be the case. When Italy [knocked off three zeroes](https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/fl-xpm-1986-06-29-8602080460-story.html) from the Italian lira in 1986, the change in the unit of account had no effect on Italian economic life. Prices and wages merely fell by a factor of 1000 and life continued as before. There are many other examples of such currency revaluations, none of them having any noticeable effect on anything beyond the number of zeroes in the bills people carry in their wallets.

However, this flies in the face of the common belief that monetary policy is powerful and has a lot of impact on economic life. If all the impact monetary policy had on the economy is the inflation tax borne by people who hold non-interest bearing currency, the impact would be miniscule compared to any other tax on the books. The way macroeconomists have historically gotten around this problem is the postulate of *nominal rigidities*: the idea that since the currency used in a particular economy serves as the unit of account, a lot of quantities in an economy are indexed to the value of the currency (in other words, they are *nominal*) without any correction for inflation or deflation, and on top of that they are also typically slow to adjust in response to changes in the value of the currency.

This allows monetary policy shocks to have a much more significant impact. For example, a big unexpected increase in inflation now obviously creates problems for financial institutions who hold onto long-term debts while leveraging through short-term borrowing; and a big deflation can cause an economic depression since nominal wages might be slow to adjust, causing real wages to be too high for a period in which the only recourse for employers is to fire workers since they can't afford to pay them the new, higher real wage.

The fact that non-inflation indexed debt contracts, wage contracts, *et cetera* are common even in countries with relatively high inflation rates is not under dispute, though as Stephen Williamson points out in [*New Monetarist Economics: Models*](https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/sr/sr443.pdf), there is some dispute about the extent to which price or wage stickiness beyond what is present in these contracts is a real phenomenon. The mystery here is why people wouldn't arrange debt and employment contracts, product orders and so on in such a way that they are naturally indexed against inflation, and why it would take them a long time to adjust when there is a change in the value of the currency. The Italian experiment cited above shows that economies are certainly easily capable of doing such a thing, so why don't they if these frictions impose such large costs? Or is the truth that the frictions *don't* impose large costs, and the nominal rigidity-based macroeconomic paradigm is simply mistaken?

I go into more detail about this puzzle and criticize some of the attempts to resolve it [here](https://ege-erdil.github.io/mysteries/industrial_revolution).
